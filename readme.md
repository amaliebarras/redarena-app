## Style Tiles

We came up with a few different concepts for styling, playing around with child-like, feminine, and friendship. We ended up going with a barn-like color scheme and sans-serif spacious type, since we knew our screens would be busy.

## Sketches

During the sketch phase, we chose a tile-like directory and a calendar layout for the "upcoming" page.

## Wireframes

I used Sketch to do these wireframes 

### Mobile

#### Directory
![](https://github.com/amaliebarras/redarena-app/blob/master/Research/Wireframes/Mobile%20Directory.png)

The biggest challenge with mobile was definitely the week view on the calendar. Not much more than a dot can fit, but we managed to fit something big enough for the thumb to tap, and then display more info. 

#### Upcoming

### Tablet

We focused a lot on tablet because it seems like a great solution for the user inside the barn. Walking around with a laptop would be bulky, but a tablet would strike the balance between lightweight & usable.
